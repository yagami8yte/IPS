EMAIL DRAFT FOR JAMES IVEY - FORTE SUPPORT
================================================================================

To: James.Ivey@csgi.com
From: yagami.byte@gmail.com
Subject: Forte Checkout v2 Integration Complete - Static IP & Terminal Recommendation Needed

================================================================================

Hi James,

Thank you for your detailed guidance via email about integrating Forte Checkout
with our COFFEEBOTIC robotic barista kiosks. Based on your recommendation, we've
successfully implemented Forte Checkout v2 and are ready for testing.


IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✓
================================================================================

Per your recommendation, we've built:

 ✓ Forte Checkout v2 (modal-based payment flow)
 ✓ Microsoft Edge WebView2 (embedded Chromium browser hosting the Forte
   Checkout modal)
 ✓ Support for both terminals: Dynaflex II Go and v400c (plug-and-play)
 ✓ Dex console for refunds (manual voids/refunds by customer support)
 ✓ Complete callback handling: onSuccess, onFailure, onCancel, onReady,
   onProcessing

Payment flow:
Customer walks up to kiosk → selects drink → Forte Checkout modal displays in
WebView2 → customer completes payment via terminal or manual entry → modal
sends callback to our application → machine makes the drink


STATIC IP ADDRESS NEEDED (BLOCKER)
================================================================================

Per your email requesting our static IP address for whitelisting:

Development Environment IP: _____._____._____._____

Production Kiosk IPs (Atlanta Airport): _____._____._____._____

Please let us know once these are whitelisted so we can begin testing.


TERMINAL DRIVER CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

You mentioned terminals can be "set up in Dex, or download the driver locally."

QUESTION: For our kiosk environment (Windows 10/11 PCs), which approach do you
recommend?
  - Option A: Configure terminals in Dex console (cloud-based)
  - Option B: Download and install driver locally on each kiosk

We prefer minimal local dependencies if possible.


TERMINAL SELECTION RECOMMENDATION NEEDED
================================================================================

We've already received both terminals from Forte for testing:
 ✓ Verifone v400c Smart Terminal (with keypad)
 ✓ Dynaflex II Go swiper

BASED ON OUR IMPLEMENTATION, WE'D LIKE YOUR RECOMMENDATION:

Our Forte Checkout integration displays the modal embedded inside our kiosk
application window (via WebView2). The modal itself supports manual card entry
via the touchscreen interface.

QUESTION: Given that Forte Checkout already provides an on-screen manual entry
option, would the Dynaflex II Go swiper alone be sufficient for our use case?

Or would you recommend the v400c with physical keypad for better reliability
in a kiosk environment?

We want to ensure we're choosing the terminal that works best with Forte
Checkout's modal interface in our embedded WebView2 setup.


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION (CODE ATTACHED)
================================================================================

I've attached four code files showing our complete Forte Checkout v2
integration for your review:

1. ForJames_ForteCheckoutService.cs
   - HTML generation with Forte Checkout JavaScript

2. ForJames_PaymentViewModel.cs
   - Payment flow and callback handling

3. ForJames_PaymentView.xaml
   - WebView2 UI integration

4. ForJames_PaymentView.xaml.cs
   - JavaScript postMessage handling

Our implementation uses:
  - Sandbox URL: https://sandbox.forte.net/checkout/v2/js
  - Production URL: https://checkout.forte.net/v2/js
  - Callbacks: onSuccess, onFailure, onCancel, onReady, onProcessing
  - Communication: window.chrome.webview.postMessage() from JavaScript to C#


TESTING PLAN
================================================================================

Once we receive confirmation on:
 1. ✓ Static IP whitelisting
 2. ✓ Terminal recommendation (Dynaflex II Go vs v400c)
 3. ✓ Driver setup method (Dex vs local)

We'll proceed with:
 1. Configure API credentials (Organization ID, Location ID) in our admin panel
 2. Test in Sandbox mode with test cards
 3. Configure and test with physical terminal (per your recommendation)
 4. Verify all callback scenarios (success, failure, cancel, error)
 5. Train customer support on Dex console for voids/refunds
 6. Switch to Production mode for live deployment


ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. For sandbox testing, do test card numbers work with Forte Checkout the
   same way they work with REST API?

2. Are there recommended timeout values for card-present transactions in
   kiosks?

3. Should we configure any transaction limits or velocity controls in Dex
   for our kiosk environment?

Please review the attached code files and let us know if our implementation
aligns with Forte's best practices for embedded Checkout integrations.

Thank you for your support!
